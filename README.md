## High-dimensional Bayesian Model for Disease-Specific Gene Detection in Spatial Transcriptomics

Identifying disease-indicative genes is critical for deciphering disease mechanisms and contin-
ues to attract significant interest. Spatial transcriptomics offers unprecedented insights for
the detection of disease-specific genes by enabling within-tissue contrasts. However, this new
technology poses challenges for conventional statistical models developed for RNA-seq, as
these models often neglect the spatial organization of tissue spots. In this article, we propose
a Bayesian shrinkage model to characterize the relationship between high-dimensional gene
expressions and the disease status of tissue spots, incorporating spatial correlation among
these spots through autoregressive terms. Our model adopts a hierarchical structure to
accommodate for the missing data within tissues and is further extended to facilitate the
analysis of multiple correlated samples. To ensure the modelâ€™s applicability to datasets of
varying sizes, we carry out two computational frameworks for Bayesian parameter estima-
tion, tailored to both small and large sample scenarios.
