The following provides a tutorial for the \textbf{BayModDSGD} package. After importing the package, we will examine the toy dataset as shown below:

```{r}
library(BayModDSGD)
data(toy)
head(toy)
```
Subsequently, the dataset will be divided into two components: X for covaraites and Y for outcome.
```{r}
x <- toy[, c("x.V1", "x.V2", "x.V3", "x.x_coord", "x.y_coord")]  
y <- toy$y  
```

Next, we will apply the function of dsgd_single to run the anslysis:

```{r}
dsgd_single(y,x,nrow(x),ncol(x)-2) # since the last two columns in x is the spatial information
```
